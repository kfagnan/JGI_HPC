UPC Study Group Homework\\
For these experiments, wen will use the CrayPat utility and therefore need to run on one of NERSC's Cray systems.  We will be using Hopper.  This is an introduction to profiling your code and is by no means comprehensive, but as we hopefully discussed during the study group, it's not always clear which parts of your code may be causing performance bottlenecks.  This is probably particularly true when making use of 3rd party software that may or may not be optimized.  

\section{Background}
 
\section{Phyldog Experiment}
Please feel free to build whatever code you would like for the following experiments on Hopper.
